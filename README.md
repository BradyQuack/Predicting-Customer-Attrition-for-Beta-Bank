# Predicting Customer Attrition for Beta Bank
View project: [Predicting Customer Attrition for Beta Bank]()
## Project Overview:
This project addresses the critical issue of customer attrition at Beta Bank, where existing clients are gradually leaving, costing the bank significantly more in new customer acquisition than retaining current customers. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that identifies customers likely to leave the bank, thereby enabling preemptive retention strategies. The model will be evaluated based on its F1 score, with a minimum target of 0.59, and its performance will also be assessed using the AUC-ROC metric to provide a comprehensive understanding of its predictive capability.
